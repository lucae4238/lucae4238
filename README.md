FullStack Web Developer

Right after I entered college I attended a programming class and as soon as I started I fell in love with Web Development. Although it is sometimes challenging, I study everyday to become the best developer I can be. 

Currently finishing <a href="https://www.soyhenry.com">Henry's</a> bootcamp while also learning TypeScript.

I am a team driven, logical, organized and focused person.. I like challenges and learning from my mistakes.


My native language is Spanish, but I also speak English as well as French. I exceed the most in Frontend development but I have Fullstack knowledge.
